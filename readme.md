**Jakarta EE 10 demo project**
- JPA (Hibernate)
- JAX-RS

JPQL, HQL, SQL queries for PostgreSQL DB, sample data is in resources.

Need to use application server to run this app. Example configurations are located in `.idea/runConfigurations`

- better to use Tomcat, the project is prepared for it
- to use WildFly, open pom.xml, uncomment CDI and JAX-RS specifications and comment its implementations. Otherwise, there will be runtime errors
    - *note: WildFly has its own datastore defined in domain.xml file, and server use it after starting application. So there could be troubles with "hibernate validate" mode.*
